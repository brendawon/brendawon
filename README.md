### Hey, I'm Brenda ⭐

Welcome to my profile! I'm a Registered Dietitian 👩🏻‍⚕️ and Software Engineer 👩🏻‍💻 . While working in healthcare during the pandemic, I needed something to occupy my mind after-hours. That became coding time. I started very gradually learning JavaScript from The Complete Web Development Course by The App Brewery. After seeing that I was able to create some cool things all on my computer, I began to seriously consider a career pivot. I made the difficult decision to take a break from healthcare to to study coding full time so I could one day address the inefficiencies I experienced and help healthcare workers use their time more efficiently to better serve patients.
